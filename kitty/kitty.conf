# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,

# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
#
# You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running
# kitty list-fonts
# The default values shown below rely on your OS to choose an appropriate monospace font family.
